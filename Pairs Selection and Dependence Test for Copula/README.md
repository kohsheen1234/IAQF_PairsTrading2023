Copula_ does not apply Garch filter. Gumbel Copula has the maximum likelihood, but GoF test shows that Gaussian Copula has a slightly lower value than Gumbel Copula. 

Copula applies Garch filter. Gaussian and Student-t Copula have the maximum likelihood, GoF test shows that Gaussian has low value.

Dependence Test does the pair selection.
